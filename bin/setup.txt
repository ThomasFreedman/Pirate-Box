An IPFS server with 1GB of storage is already setup.
You may change that or create a Liberty Library using 
this setup wizard.

To minimize setup time the following are used:
1) Country:  United States
2) Language: US English
3) Timezone: Central
4) Keyboard: Generic 105 key PC

You may change those settings and customize your new Pirate Box after going through these steps by selecting "Preferences" from the upper left Pirate menu. 

This setup wizard will ask you to:

- Change the default password for the ipfs account 
- Choose a folder and amount of storage space to use for IPFS

After completing those 2 steps and getting online you will be able to browse websites on IPFS and save your own files there too! Shall we get started?
